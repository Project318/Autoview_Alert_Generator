NOTE: ONCE YOU PRESS OK, MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT DO ANYTHING ELSE (DO NOT SELECT OTHER WINDOWS WHILE THE TEXT IS TYPING) UNTIL THE TEXT IS DONE APPEARING IN NOTEPAD OTHERWISE THE TEXT OUTPUT WILL BE SENT TO ANY ACTIVE WINDOW

Got fed up doing mistakes in copy/pasting autoview alerts, so I thought id try and automate the alert generation.

Simple AutoIT code to properly generate autoview alerts in notepad.

Autoview website: https://autoview.with.pink/

Get Autoview Extension for Google chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autoview/okdhadoplaoehmeldlpakhpekjcpljmb

Download AutoIT at: https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/

Script uses autoit Extended InputBox from: https://github.com/jesobreira/extinputbox_au3

Autoview_Alert_Generator.exe is the compiled (x86) version of the script.
